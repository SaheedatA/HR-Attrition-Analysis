-  This project delves into the world of human resources, with a keen eye on data analysis to optimize talent management and organizational performance.

 - In this project, I take a critical look at the factors responsible for employee attrition in the firm. 

 - The term attrition refers to a gradual reductiion in staff numbers that occurs as employees leave a company and are not replaced. In these dashboards, I conducted a diagonostic analysis of the organisation's humna resources management data.

 - In this dashboard, grouping plays a crucial role in organizing and presenting the data effectively. The design of the dashboard is tailored to utilize the power of grouping for enhanced data visualization and analysis.
 
 - The first page provides an overview of all the four dashboards I created. The second page includes the demographic insights, the third page focuses on turnover analysis and the final page is dedicated to employee wellness.
